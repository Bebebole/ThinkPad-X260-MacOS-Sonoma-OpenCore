## What doesn't work

 - iServices (like iMessage or FaceTime) do not work `maybe it's possible to fix it with itlwm, Heliport and an AppleID with a good reputation`
 - I can't say if the SD reader works because it's broken on my laptop

## Scripts

In the repo there is a `Scripts` folder with scripts that are recommended for a good experience on macOS.
